a) Relation between the schema, database and view can be described with an analogy such as the floor plan of house to the actual building and the individual room in the house. A schema provides the logical description of all entities (tables) inside the database along with their relations and indexes etc. A database is the realization of the schema consisting of several tables.

b) SQL table is physical entity of a database, which is a collection of records. A view is a logical subset of the table, which is created usually when the table is too big to query upon or to provide limited preview of data based on user access.
